# Node-SmartHive-Website
Completed Website using Node.js,Socket.io and MQTTClient using a mosquitto.

Features of the Project:

-Graphing the data sent from Raspberry pi3 on a nice graphs that are easy to read.

-Giving you real time data in an easy to understand way.

-Website is easy to navigate and minimalistic, getting rid of all un-necessary features


Planned features:

-Email,Tweeter,Facebook notification for a user if the gyroscope angle changed to anything above 30* on any Axis.

-Email,Tweeter,Facebook notification for a user if the temperature inside the hive increases drastically, or decreases.

-Contact us section as well as FAQ section for easier troubleshooting of the system.


Where do I find code for Mqtt,MQTTClient and for sensors of Rpi?
All of those should be somewhere on my github, do some searching for now, later I will add all the links to everything here when the website will be 100%.
